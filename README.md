# StackOverflow video bot

This was inspired by [this](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot) project done by Lewis Menelaws & TMRRW.
The original project makes TikTok length videos out of Reddit questions.

This project takes in the URL for both a background video and the question you want to use and generates a video. Of course, this could be done manually, but where's the fun in that?

## Requirements

NodeJS

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. From within the projects directory on your machine run `npm install`
3. To run the CLI app, again from the projects directory run `node .` or `node index.js`

## Contributing

At the moment I'm not looking for others to contribute to the main branch/fork of this app. You're more than welcome to fork the project and make changes but anything pushed to main will be ignored.

If in the future this changes and I'm looking for additional contributors this will be updated to reflect that. In the meantime, if you'd like to suggest a feature open an issue and if it's reasonable I'll try to implement it.
